# WatchMe

## ðŸ¤” About the project
This project is a challenge from Rocketseat's Ignite course, to train on what I've learned so far withÂ ReactJS

This will be an application where the main objective is to refactor a page to list movies according to genre.

This project uses JSON Server to simulate an API that has information about genres and movies.
